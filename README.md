### ERAD 2018 Short Course on Community Radar Software
The course will take place on July 1st 2018, right before the [ERAD 2018 conference](http://www.erad2018.nl/). We will introduce the participants to [community software packages](http://openradarscience.org) designed for radar data processing, including (but not limited to) [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/), [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/), and [wradlib](https://wradlib.org). 

The common ground for most of those tools is Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. For the course, we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) that contains all the required software, data, and course materials.

### Registration 
Watch the [ERAD 2018 website](http://www.erad2018.nl/) for upcoming info on registration and associated costs for luch and coffee breaks (to be expected in the order of 50-75 Euros). Beware that the maximum number of participants is limited to 30.

### Tentative list of tutors
- Crisologo, Irene (University of Potsdam, Germany)
- Collis, Scott (Argonne National Laboratory, USA)
- Heistermann, Maik (University of Potsdam, Germany)
- Michelson, Daniel B. (Environment and Climate Change Canada)
- Muehlbauer, Kai (University of Bonn, Germany)
- ...?

### Things you need to prepare
Participants need to bring their own 64-bit notebook (Linux, Windows, Mac). All you need to do is to install VirtualBox and import the Virtual Machine for the course. Please see http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/ for detailed instructions, but, in time, we will also send around an e-Mail to the registered participants.

### Course program
The course will take place roughly between 9:00 and 17:00. As pointed out above, we will feature an overview of open source weather radar software packages, and discuss how open source community software could contribute to make science and applications more transparent, reproducible, and efficient. Most parts of the course will consist of hands-on exercises, indluding a Python quick start, applications of packages such as BALTRAD, Py-ART, and wradlib, and demonstrations of how these packages could interact. A more detailed course program will be publiehd here in due time.
